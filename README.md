# Reverie

Reverie is a simple, elegant, and dark theme for Neovim. It's designed for those moments of deep focus, when the world fades away and all that's left is you and your code.

> Where sky and shadow softly meet,  
> the world outside makes its retreat.  
> The mind, in silent reverie,  
> is calmed by light it came to see,  
> and finds itself completely free.
